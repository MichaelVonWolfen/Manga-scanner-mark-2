# Manga-scanner-mark-2
This is the second try at creating a manga scanning application for multiple sites. It uses Go as programming language and RabbitMQ for communication, all wrapped in a Docker container &lt;3

# Reason for creating

Having to deal with hundreds of different manga/manhwa url, even if they are being bookmarked is a hell,
when after some time the website url changes or worse, when they alter the url's
for each of their mangas, meaning that you have to change all those bookmarks again and again and... ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤

That is why I decided to create this project...
